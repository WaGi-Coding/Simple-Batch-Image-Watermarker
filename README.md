## What is this for?
If you want to watermark your images, you can use this tool.
- It allows you to watermark all images inside a folder.
- It allows you to watermark single images.
- You can use your own watermark image.
- It also allows you to write a EXIF Copyright Text.



## Simple Batch Image Watermarker for Windows supporting Watermarking of a whole folders images.

The Repeat-Mode starts drawing from the image center, unlike others who just draw starting from top-left.
The watermark gets automatically resized to fit, if the Image to get watermarked is smaller than the Watermark.

You can also Drag & Drop a Folder/Image onto the Textboxes, instead of manually inputting or searching.

The "Watermarked-Folder" will end up inside your input folder. You can change the name of that folder and change the suffix of watermarked images.
All values get saved & loaded, so it's more comfortable to use.
